    "For this project, I will write a Python application which will be used to benchmark five different sorting algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following 5 algorithms will be discussed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A simple comparison-based sort: Insertion Sort\n",
    "2. A simple comparison-based sort: Selection Sort\n",
    "3. A simple comparison-based sort: Bubble Sort\n",
    "4. An efficient comparison-based sort:  Quicksort\n",
    "5. A non-comparison sort: Bucket Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring for this report will be as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python Application (15 marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Introduction (10 marks): Introduce the concept of sorting and sorting algorithms, discuss the relevance of concepts such as complexity (time and space), performance, in-place sorting, stable sorting, comparator functions, comparison-based and non-comparison-based sorts, etc. \n",
    "2. Sorting Algorithms (5 x 5 = 25 marks): Introduce each of your chosen algorithms in turn, discuss their space and time complexity, and explain how each algorithm works using your own diagrams and different example input instances. \n",
    "3. Implementation & Benchmarking (10 marks): This section will describe the process followed when implementing the Java application above, and will present the results of your benchmarking. Discuss how the measured performance of the algorithms differed â€“ were the results similar to what you would expect, given the time complexity of each chosen algorithm? In this section you should use both a table and a graph to summarise the results obtained (see samples below). \n"
