# Computational-Thinking-Project-2019

## Eimear Butler, April 2019

--------

This repository contains my Computational Thinking Project 2019 submission. 

The primary document is the Jupyter Notebook "Sorting_Algorithms.ipynb".

To run this document you must have installed software to run python code (https://www.python.org/), for example the Anaconda package (https://www.anaconda.com/).

By running each cell in succession, it will generate a dataframe of randomly generated numbers that are somewhat reflective of real life real estate sales data.

All references and sources used to support the code creation are documented within the ipynb file. No other datasets are required.

All supplimentary documentation is also stored in the repository.
