# Computational-Thinking-Project-2019

For this project, I will write a Python application which will be used to benchmark five different sorting algorithms. 

The following 5 algorithms will be discussed:

1. A simple comparison-based sort (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort or Insertion Sort)
2. An efficient comparison-based sort (Merge Sort, Quicksort or Heap Sort)
3. A non-comparison sort (Counting Sort, Bucket Sort or Radix Sort)
4. Any other sorting algorithm of your choice
5. Any other sorting algorithm of your choice

In orderto visualise
