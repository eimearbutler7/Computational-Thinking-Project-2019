# Computational-Thinking-Project-2019

For this project, I will write a Python application which will be used to benchmark five different sorting algorithms. 

The following 5 algorithms will be discussed:

1. A simple comparison-based sort: (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort or Insertion Sort)
2. An efficient comparison-based sort:  (Merge Sort, Quicksort or Heap Sort)
3. A non-comparison sort: (Counting Sort, Bucket Sort or Radix Sort)
4. AN Other 
5. AN Other 

In order to visualise the types of  

Comparison 
Non-comparison


Simple
Efficient 



### Insertion Sort (Simple and efficient on small data): 

This sort takes each element, one by one and sorts it relative to all previously sorted data. By moving systematically through the data set, it eventually moves the elements into order. 

A visual demonstration of this is seen below...

### Selection Sort (Simple and efficient on small data): 

This sort runs through either the full set of data (first run) or a subset of the data that has not been assigned a final location yet (all other remaining runs) each time to see which of the elements meets the criteria for the next position (lowest or highest depending on the requirements of the algorithm). Once it establishes the element that best fits, it allocates the element into that position and then moves onto the next run to find the next element that will best fit the next position. This again requires the algorith to look at all remaining elements.that do not yet have a location. 


A visual demonstration of this is seen below...
